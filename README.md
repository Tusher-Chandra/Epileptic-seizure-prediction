# Epileptic-seizure-prediction
Short Brief: Unlike standard prediction systems, this project focuses on pre-ictal signal and non-ictal signals for predicting seizure. Which is completely a unique approach.
Here are two codes, "nonseiz_extraction_code_FT.m" for extracting the non-ictal values and "preictal_extraction_code_FT.m" is for pre-ictals.
